## 🔴 P1 — Do These First

These are bugs or correctness issues affecting real users right now.

### [ ] Penny rounding — whole-cent splits everywhere
**Size:** M (half day)
**Why:** The current math can produce per-person amounts that don't sum exactly to the
total. This is a trust issue — if the numbers don't add up to the cent, users notice.
**What to do:**
- Add a `splitEvenly(total, n)` helper that works in integer cents and distributes
  remainder pennies to the first N people (largest-remainder method)
- Replace all `Math.round(x * 100) / 100` split calculations with this helper
- For custom splits with tax/tip: after proportional distribution, find the 1-cent
  discrepancy (if any) and add it to the person with the largest fractional remainder
- In `simplifyDebts()` and `computeDirectPayments()`: normalise all balances to nearest
  cent before processing; round each payment amount before pushing
- Guard against negative amounts in `addExpense()`: reject if amount <= 0

### [ ] markDone() uses list index, not stable payment identity
**Size:** S (1-2 hours)
**Why:** When user toggles Smart ↔ Direct payment mode, the list re-renders and marks
shift to wrong payments. This is a data integrity bug.
**What to do:**
- Replace `markDone(i)` index with `markDone('from-to')` key (e.g. `'2-0'`)
- Change done-chip id to `done-${pay.from}-${pay.to}`
- Maintain a `_markedKeys = new Set()` that survives re-renders
- On render, restore `.marked` class from the set

### [ ] editExpense() leaves top amount field blank
**Size:** S (30 mins)
**Why:** When editing any existing expense, the top amount input shows blank. Confusing.
**What to do:**
- At end of `editExpense(id)`, after `setSplitType()`:
  `document.getElementById('exp-amount-top').value = exp.amount.toFixed(2)`
- Also fix `cancelEdit()` to clear the top amount field

### [ ] goHome() silently destroys unsaved local-mode data
**Size:** S (30 mins)
**Why:** Clicking the logo when in local mode (no Supabase tab saved yet) loses all work.
**What to do:**
- In `goHome()`: if not on step 0 AND `state.people.length > 0` AND `!state.tabId`,
  show a confirm dialog before navigating

### [ ] Realtime INSERT race: _pendingLocalIds never checked
**Size:** S (30 mins)
**Why:** Can produce brief duplicate expense cards when saving on a slow connection.
**What to do:**
- In the INSERT realtime handler: add `if (_pendingLocalIds.size > 0) return;` before
  the existing duplicate-ID check

## 🟡 P2 — High Value, Ship Soon

### [ ] Replace alert() with inline form errors
**Size:** M
**Why:** alert() is jarring on mobile. Every validation failure pops a native dialog.
**What to do:**
- Add `div#expense-form-error` below the "+ Add expense" button, hidden by default
- Style: `font-size:12px; color:var(--red); margin-top:8px; text-align:center;`
- Replace all `alert()` in `addExpense()` with `showFormError('message')`
- Flash red border on the specific missing field
- Auto-clear after 4 seconds or on next interaction

### [ ] Keyboard Enter submits expense form
**Size:** S
**Why:** Desktop users fill the form with keyboard and must mouse-click to submit.
**What to do:**
- Add `onkeydown="if(event.key==='Enter') addExpense()"` to:
  `#exp-desc`, `#exp-amount-top`, `#exp-amount-personal`, `#exp-tax`, `#exp-tip`

### [ ] "You" card accent border + badge on settle page
**Size:** S
**Why:** Your card is first in the list but looks identical to everyone else's. The most
important card should be visually distinct.
**What to do:**
- `.person-card.you-card { border-color: var(--accent); }`
- Add `<span class="you-badge">You</span>` next to name in card header
- `.you-badge { font-size:10px; background:var(--accent-bg); color:var(--accent);
  padding:2px 7px; border-radius:99px; font-weight:700; margin-left:6px;
  text-transform:uppercase; letter-spacing:0.5px; }`

### [ ] "New tab" button danger styling
**Size:** XS
**Why:** Sits next to "← Edit expenses" with identical styling. Misclick destroys work.
**What to do:**
- Add class `btn-new-tab` to the button
- `.btn-ghost.btn-new-tab:hover { color: var(--red); }`
- Already has ⚠ prefix from prior work — keep it

### [ ] Home screen value prop for first-time visitors
**Size:** S
**Why:** First-time visitors see "Name your tab / What's the occasion?" with zero context.
**What to do:**
- Add above `.section-title` on step 0, only when `su-recent-tabs` is empty in
  localStorage:
  ```html
  <div class="hero-tagline">
    Split any expense. Settle up fairly.<br>
    <span>No sign-up. No app. Just share a link.</span>
  </div>
  ```
- Style: centered, large-ish font, muted subtext, fades in with the step animation
- Hide it once the user has any recent tabs (returning users don't need it)

### [ ] Person removal confirmation shows amounts
**Size:** XS
**Why:** Confirm dialog lists expense names but not amounts. Users can't judge what they're losing.
**What to do:**
- Change the affected expenses list to: `• ${e.desc} (${fmt(e.amount)})`

### [ ] Sub-dollar balance treatment
**Size:** S
**Why:** "Chris owes $0.82" creates real-world awkwardness. Tiny residuals should be
visually softened.
**What to do:**
- In person card rendering: if `Math.abs(bal) < 1.00` and `bal !== 0`, add class
  `is-micro` to the card
- `.person-card.is-micro { opacity: 0.65; }`
- Change verdict text to "basically settled ($0.82)" in muted color

### [ ] PWA manifest — move from data URI to real file
**Size:** S
**Why:** Chrome on Android won't show "Add to Home Screen" for data URI manifests.
**What to do:**
- Decode the current base64 manifest content and save as `/manifest.json`
- Change `<link rel="manifest">` to `href="/manifest.json"`
- Verify icons are referenced correctly

### [ ] Check og-image.png exists in repo root
**Size:** XS
**Why:** Meta tags reference `/og-image.png` — if missing, all share link previews
show a broken image.
**What to do:**
- Check repo root for `og-image.png`
- If missing: create a simple 1200×630 SVG/PNG with the SettlingUp logo on dark
  background and save as `og-image.png`

## 🟢 P3 — Good Features, Schedule When P1+P2 Done

### [ ] Venmo / Cash App deep links on payment cards
**Size:** M
**Why:** Users are about to open Venmo anyway. Pre-filling the amount is a genuine
time-saver and a natural monetization hook.
**What to do:**
- Add a "Pay on Venmo" button to each payment card (only shown for the current user's
  outgoing payments)
- Venmo deep link: `venmo://paycharge?txn=pay&recipients=&amount=${pay.amount}&note=SettlingUp`
- Cash App: `https://cash.app/$<tag>/${pay.amount}`
- Store optional Venmo/CashApp handle in identity (localStorage per tab)
- If no handle set: show button greyed with "Add your Venmo" tooltip
- NEEDS-DECISION: Design of the handle input UX

### [ ] Tip jar / "buy me a coffee" moment
**Size:** S
**Why:** Contextual ask at the highest-value moment — right after settling.
**What to do:**
- On first load of step 3 (settle page), if `su-tipped` not in localStorage, show a
  dismissable card at the bottom of the payments list:
  *"SettlingUp saved you the math 🧮 Buy the developer a coffee?"*
  with $1 / $3 / $5 Stripe links and a "Maybe later" dismiss
- Set `su-tipped=dismissed` on dismiss; `su-tipped=yes` on click
- Never show again after either action
- NEEDS-DECISION: Stripe account and payment links

### [ ] Expense list search/filter
**Size:** M
**Why:** With 20+ expenses, finding one to edit is painful.
**What to do:**
- Show a search input above the expense list only when `state.expenses.length >= 8`
- Filter in real time by description (case insensitive)
- Clear button on the input
- "No expenses match" empty state

### [ ] Tab expiry warning
**Size:** M
**Why:** Tabs will be deleted after 90 days (future cron job). Users should know.
**What to do:**
- Add `last_accessed_at` column to tabs table (NEEDS-DECISION: schema change)
- Update it on every tab load
- On settle page: if tab is 80+ days old, show warning banner:
  "This tab expires in X days — reshare the link to keep it active."

### [ ] PDF / share export
**Size:** L
**Why:** Groups want to send a clean summary. High perceived value.
**What to do:**
- "Export summary" button on settle page
- Generates a clean HTML print view: tab name, date, total, payment list, breakdown
- "Powered by settlingup.app" footer
- `window.print()` or jsPDF (CDN) — NEEDS-DECISION on approach
- This is the Pro feature unlock candidate

### [ ] Duplicate expense warning
**Size:** S
**Why:** Users adding expenses manually often accidentally duplicate them.
**What to do:**
- In `addExpense()`: before saving, check if any existing expense has the same
  description (case insensitive) AND same amount
- If match found: show inline warning (not blocking): "You already have a
  '[desc]' for $X — is this a duplicate?" with "Add anyway" / "Cancel" buttons

### [ ] Currency selector
Tab-level USD/EUR/GBP/CAD/AUD/JPY picker. Store in tabs table. New column required.

### [ ] Expense categories + breakdown chart
Tag each expense (Food, Transport, etc.). Donut chart on settle page. Pro feature candidate.

### [ ] Offline queue / retry
Failed saves retry automatically. Local queue with persistent state.

### [ ] Dynamic OG meta per tab

### [ ] Tab summary read-only page
`/t/<code>/summary` — clean read-only settle view for sending to non-participants.

### [ ] Viewer mode
Skip identity picker, browse tab without being a participant.

### [ ] Service worker / PWA caching
Cache current tab's data. Works offline.

## Analytics Queries to Run Weekly

The agent should run these against Supabase and include results in the weekly brief:

```sql
-- New tabs this week
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tabs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Total active tabs (accessed in last 30 days)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tabs
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Total expenses added this week
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM expenses
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Average expenses per tab (active tabs)
SELECT AVG(exp_count) FROM (
  SELECT tab_id, COUNT(*) as exp_count FROM expenses
  GROUP BY tab_id
) sub;

-- Split type breakdown
SELECT split_type, COUNT(*) as n FROM expenses
GROUP BY split_type ORDER BY n DESC;

-- Tabs by people count (from jsonb array length)
SELECT jsonb_array_length(people) as people_count, COUNT(*) as tabs
FROM tabs GROUP BY people_count ORDER BY people_count;
```
